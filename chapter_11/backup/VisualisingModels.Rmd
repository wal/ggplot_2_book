```



```{r}

top3 <- c("Bryan-College Station", "Lubbock", "NE Tarrant County")
bottom3 <- c("McAllen", "Brownsville", "Harlingen")
extreme <- txhousing %>% ungroup() %>%
  filter(city %in% c(top3, bottom3), !is.na(sales)) %>%
  mutate(city = factor(city, c(top3, bottom3)))

ggplot(extreme, aes(month, log(sales))) + 
  geom_line(aes(group = year)) + 
  facet_wrap(~city)

ggplot(extreme, aes(month, sales)) + 
  geom_line(aes(group = year)) + 
  facet_wrap(~city,scales = "free" )



```
The cities with low R2 have weaker seasonal patterns and more variation between years. The data for Harlingen seems particularly noisy.


## Exercises

Do your conclusions change if you use a different measurement of model fit? Why/why not?

```{r}
models <- txhousing %>%
  group_by(city) %>%
  do(mod = lm(log(sales) ~ factor(month), data = ., na.action = na.exclude)) 

model_sum <- models %>% glance(mod)

ggplot(model_sum, aes(r.squared, reorder(city, r.squared))) + geom_point()
ggplot(model_sum, aes(log(p.value), reorder(city, log(p.value)))) + geom_point()
ggplot(model_sum, aes(statistic, reorder(city, statistic))) + geom_point()

```


One possible hypothesis that explains why McAllen, Harlingen and Brownsville have lower R2 is that theyâ€™re smaller towns so there are fewer sales and more noise. Confirm or refute this hypothesis.

```{r}
top3 <- c("Bryan-College Station", "Lubbock", "NE Tarrant County")
bottom3 <- c("McAllen", "Brownsville", "Harlingen")
extreme <- txhousing %>% ungroup() %>%
  filter(city %in% c(top3, bottom3), !is.na(sales)) %>%
  mutate(city = factor(city, c(top3, bottom3)))

ggplot(extreme, aes(month, sales)) + 
  geom_line(aes(group = year)) + 
  facet_wrap(~city,scales = "free" )

```

McAllen, Harlingen and Brownsville seem to have much more year-to- year variation than Midland, Irving and Denton County. How does the model change if you also include a linear trend for year? (i.e. log(sales) ~ factor(month) + year).

it improves for the smaller sales cities, reduces for biggersales cities


```{r}
top3 <- c("Bryan-College Station", "Lubbock", "NE Tarrant County")
bottom3 <- c("McAllen", "Brownsville", "Harlingen")

extreme <- txhousing %>% ungroup() %>%
  filter(city %in% c(top3, bottom3), !is.na(sales)) %>%
  mutate(city = factor(city, c(top3, bottom3)))

models <- extreme %>%
  group_by(city) %>%
  do(mod = lm(log(sales) ~ factor(month), data = ., na.action = na.exclude)) 

model_sum <- models %>% glance(mod)

ggplot(model_sum, aes(r.squared, reorder(city, r.squared))) + geom_point()


models <- extreme %>%
  group_by(city) %>%
  do(mod = lm(log(sales) ~ factor(month) + year, data = ., na.action = na.exclude)) 

model_sum <- models %>% glance(mod)

ggplot(model_sum, aes(r.squared, reorder(city, r.squared))) + geom_point()

```

 Create a faceted plot that shows the seasonal patterns for all cities. Order the facets by the R2 for the city.
 
```{r}
data("txhousing")
models <- txhousing %>%
  group_by(city) %>%
  do(mod = lm(log(sales) ~ factor(month), data = ., na.action = na.exclude)) 

cities_by_r_squared <- model_sum <- models %>% glance(mod) %>% arrange(r.squared) %>% select(city)
summary(cities_by_r_squared)
summary(unique(txhousing$city))

txhousing$city_f <- factor(txhousing$city, levels = cities_by_r_squared$city)

ggplot(txhousing, aes(month, log(sales))) + 
  geom_line(aes(group = year)) + 
  facet_wrap(~city_f)
```
